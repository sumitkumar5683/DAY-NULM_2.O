                  DAY-NULM in its present structure covers urban poor in general
                  and does not have any geographic targeting, especially
                  communities living in slums. However, it has been brought to
                  the notice that community led interventions in slums, which
                  are the hotbeds of poverty, would be an effective mechanism.
                  An effective mechanism to encourage Jan Bhagidari in slums
                  would empower the community by involving them in their
                  development process, beginning from problem identification to
                  decision making.{" "}
